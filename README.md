# Time-Series-Analysis---Project
This is time series analyst project for six different correlated data.
- Selected the optimal lag order for Vector Autoregressive (VAR) models through comprehensive model evaluation, ensuring accurate forecasting.
- Able to assess stationarity and cointegration in time series data, distinguished between stationary and non-stationary processes
- Conducted Granger causality tests to uncover causal relationships within time series data, supporting data-driven decision-making.
- Proficient in modeling cointegrated time series data using Vector Error Correction Models (VECM), performing Johansen cointegration tests, and dynamic forecasting.
